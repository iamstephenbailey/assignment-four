                <h2>It's Not Creepy If Its Romantic!</h2>
                <p>
                    I met my wife through one of the most unconventional ways...mild stalking. 
                    Which is OBVIOUSLY classified as romantic because of my countless endearing
                    qualities which makes stuff like that okay. You see, I never throw parties 
                </p>

                <h3>Wait Wait Wait....WHAT TIME?</h3>
                <P>
                    On our first date, everything clicked. We liked the same time things. We were both college athletes. Our religious 
                    views were aligned. I even let her beat me in mini-golf. I'm such a gentleman. At one point we realized we had the 
                    same birthday. And when I say same birthday I mean down to the year. Incredibly enough, she was FIVE MINUTES older 
                    than me! It wasn't until over a year later that we realized I was born in EST, while she was born in CST, which 
                    means that I am instead 55 minutes older, and undoubtedbly 55 minutes wiser.
