                    <h2>"It's Not Creepy If Its Romantic!"</h2>
                    <p>
                        I met this girl through one of the most unconventional ways...mild stalking and evil genius. Which is OBVIOUSLY classified as romantic because of my endearing
                        qualities which makes stuff like that okay. You see, I never throw parties, I haven't thrown one since my 11th birthday when 
                        <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/863/725/e74.gif">no one came.</a> 
                        So throwing parties was a sore subject for me. But some mutual friends had insisted that we meet, and when I saw her photo, I wholeheartedly agreed. Unfortunately
                        for me, those mutual friends weren't as up to the task in matchmaking as I hoped they would be, so after 3 months of little to no effort, I hatched a 
                        plan of my own. I threw a small game night at my apartment, and invite the "matchmakers", who just like I predicted, invited the girl. Everything that night 
                        went according to plan, and three days later the girl and I went on our first date.

                    <h3>"Wait Wait Wait....AT WHAT TIME?"</h3>
                    <P>
                        On that date, everything clicked. We liked the same time things. We were both college athletes. Our religious 
                        views were aligned. We were like
                        <a href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/f0721a36db3dffddebfef3c4337e3276/tenor.gif?itemid=4495828">peas and carrots.</a> 
                        I even let her beat me in mini-golf. I'm such a gentleman. At one point we realized we had the 
                        same birthday. And when I say same birthday I mean <b>SAME BIRTHDAY</b>, down to the year. Incredibly enough, it turns out that she was FIVE MINUTES older 
                        than me! It wasn't until over a year later that we realized I was born in EST, while she was born in CST, which 
                        means that I am instead 55 minutes older, and undoubtedbly 55 minutes wiser. Within the first month, we were both in love.
                    </P>

                        Then, just like that, she was gone. After she finished PT school, she went back home to Kansas City to live near here parents and 
                        work at KU Hospital where she had a job lined up. And that left me in a bad way. I mean, REAL BAD. I'm talking post-apocalyptic, survival 
                        of the fittest bad. Clean air became a commodity, along with gas masks. So naturally, I became a warlord and started a cult. Many joined. I even killed a guy. Okay, well, I killed a bunch of people. Often. It was 
                        a dark time in my life, okay?! All in all we spent 421 days apart.

                    <h5>"A New Chapter"</h5>
                    <p>
                        I had everything, everything in the world, except her. Well, technically I did still have her and we were still together, just 1,250 miles apart. So
                        I said screw it, and gave it all up. World domination and loyal subjects meant nothing without her there to terrorize people with me, so I left it all 
                        behind and drove to Kansas City. No job lined up or applicable job experience or skills, just love in my heart and long list of people I murdered
                        along the way. And I wouldn't change a thing.
